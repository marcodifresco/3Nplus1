# 3N plus 1
The 3N plus 1, or more appropriately the "Collatz conjecture", is a common mathematic problem that regardless its fame it remain unsolved.

The problem states that every positive integer number will lead to 1 by repeating the following processes:
* if the number is even, the next term is one half of the previous term;
* if the number is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1 (hence the name).
